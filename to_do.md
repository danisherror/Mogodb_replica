Perfect — you're aiming to implement a **robust master-slave architecture with automatic master failover** using Node.js and MongoDB. This is essentially a **leader election** problem in a distributed system.

---

## ✅ Your Goal Recap

* **3 nodes** running identical Node.js services.
* One node is elected **Master**.
* Other two are **Slaves**.
* If Master fails, **Slaves elect a new Master**.
* System **self-heals** and maintains single-writer consistency.

---

## 🧠 Design Strategy

We’ll use the following components:

### 1. **Heartbeat Mechanism**

* Each node pings others regularly.
* If a node doesn't respond after a timeout, it's marked as "dead".

### 2. **Leader Election Algorithm**

Use a **Bully Algorithm** (simple and suitable for small clusters).

### 3. **Node Roles**

Each node:

* Can act as master or slave
* Maintains internal state: `"master"` or `"slave"`
* Has a **priority ID** (e.g., node1 = 1, node2 = 2, etc.)

---

## 🔄 Failover Flow

1. Each node starts up and knows about other nodes.
2. They ping each other every few seconds.
3. If a node doesn’t get a response from the current master:

   * It checks its own priority.
   * If it's the highest-priority alive node → promotes itself to **master**.
   * Others acknowledge the change.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Node.js + Express**
* **MongoDB** (each node can have local DB or shared DB with replica set)
* **Axios** for inter-node communication

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
/node
  config.js
  server.js
  leaderElection.js
  roles.js
/shared
  models/Data.js
```

## 🚀 Do You Want...

### Option A:

I build the full starter template (one Node.js app that behaves as either master or slave depending on election)?

### Option B:

You want me to give you detailed **code for heartbeat + election + role switch**?

Let me know — I can provide a ready-to-run election system step-by-step, with clean failover logic.
